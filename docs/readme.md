# Documentation

We'll be using diagram as code, so that any changes code should be reflected to the documentation.

All documentation files should be put in this directory.

Our documentation must consists:

1. Sequence diagrams [mermaid-js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid)
2. Architecture diagrams [mingrammer](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com)
3. Swagger for API Spec [swaggo](https://github.com/swaggo/swag)
4. Flowchart (optional) [mermaid-js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid)

All diagrams will be generated when your PR is merged to master.
